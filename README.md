#Github-Users

App for viewing users of github. 

##Current features and defects

###Features:
- The checkbox state is remembered
- You can change the page by clicking next, previous, or typing the page you'd like
- page number is remembered
    - so a user can easily return to the last user they were viewing

###Defects:
- In order for the page in the textbox to be loaded, the user must refresh the page
- The page does not match the mock up

##If I had more time I would:
- Learn how to properly use the state in tandem with local storage of the UserView component to update the UserList component when the page number is changed. 
- Learn about implementing the redux pattern in React
- Make the page follow the wire frame
- Add functionality to select all/unselect all so the user doesn't have to click on too many check boxes
- Create a view to see all unchecked/checked users
- Add appropriate tab-indexes
